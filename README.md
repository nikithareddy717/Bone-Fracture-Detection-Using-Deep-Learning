# Bone-Fracture-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
In recent years, bone fracture detection has been a widely discussed topic and many researchers have proposed different methods to tackle this problem. Despite this, Bone fractures are common medical conditions that require accurate and timely diagnosis for effective treatment. Traditional methods of fracture detection, such as X-ray examination, heavily rely on the expertise of radiologists and can be time-consuming. With the advancements in deep learning techniques, there is a growing interest in developing automated systems for bone fracture detection.. Each study is summarized and evaluated using a radar graph with six values: area under the curve (AUC), test accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, dataset size and labelling reliability.
